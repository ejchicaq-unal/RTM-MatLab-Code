Abstract
RTM is a depth migration method that implements a solution of the full wave equation. In this work, a methodology for the application of RTM to synthetic and real data is developed. We discuss the components of RTM: Acoustic wave modeling, boundary conditions and imaging condition. A Finite Difference Method (FDM) based on a staggered grid scheme was implemented for the wave modeling. A Hibryd ABC method that combines two of the most common solutions to the problem of boundary conditions: predictive boundary condition and absorbing boundary condition. RTM images were obtained using a Cross-correlation Imaging Condition with Wavefield Decomposition. The algorithm was applied to synthetic data obtained by modeling a complex geological structure, with a known velocity model. On real data, an image of the complex structure was obtained, which allowed us to know the real location of the reflection events. The obtained seismic image better resolved the seismic events compared with conventional methods of migration.
Keywords: Migration, Imaging, RTM, Finite Difference Method, Full Wave Equation, Boundary Condition, Imaging Condition.
