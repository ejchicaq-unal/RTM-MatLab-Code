RTM MatLAb Code is an open-source library for modelling and inversion and in geophysics. The object-oriented library provides management for structured and unstructured meshes in 2D and 3D, finite-element and finite-volume solvers, various geophysical forward operators, as well as Gauss-Newton based frameworks for constrained, joint and fully-coupled inversions with flexible regularization.

What is pyGIMLi suited for?

-   analyze, visualize and invert geophysical data in a reproducible manner
-   forward modelling of (geo)physical problems on complex 2D and 3D geometries
-   inversion with flexible controls on a-priori information and regularization
-   combination of different methods in constrained, joint and fully-coupled inversions
-   teaching applied geophysics (e.g. in combination with [Jupyter notebooks])

What is pyGIMLi **NOT** suited for?

-   for people that expect a ready-made GUI for interpreting their data
